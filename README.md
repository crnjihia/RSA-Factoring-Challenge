RSA Factoring Challenge

Overview

This project is part of the RSA Factoring Challenge where the goal is to factorize large numbers into a product of smaller numbers. For Task 0, the challenge is to factorize as many numbers as possible. For Task 1, the goal is to factorize an RSA number into two prime factors.

The project includes two main programs:

factors: This program factorizes numbers into two smaller factors.
rsa: This program factorizes RSA numbers into two prime factors.
